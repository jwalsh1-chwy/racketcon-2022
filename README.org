* Sessions 

** DONE The final tier is Shed: Inside the Wizard Engine’s fast in-place interpreter for WebAssembly

- https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine

+ static compilation 
+ 2017 turbofan

- wasm code
- side table for conditions
- simple value table for refs and numberics 

https://github.com/titzer/virgil

*** side-table 


- delta ip is used for the conditional flow for the fallthrough
- delta xip 
- vals
- pop (number of values)


side table is 30% of original bytecode

*** Performance tuning

check the benchmarks looking for

- bicg mvt atax symm 2mm adi jacobi-2d

*** Outcomes 

- side table design

** DONE Shallow and Optional Types

- https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/actions

- https://github.com/racket/typed-racket

- https://cs.brown.edu/people/bgreenma/sitemap.html

- Typed Racket: ~#lang typed/racket~

- ~#lang typed/racket/shallow~ and ~#lang typed/racket/optional~

- shallow can be things like ~[str]~

- when looking at the shape check like list and ~car~ or ~cdr~

#+begin_src lisp
  (: says-moo? (-> Listof Symbol)
     Boolean))
#+end_src

- run through deep, shallow, optional

- examples for calls based on nthe lang 

#+begin_src lisp
(-> String)
#+end_src

- 8.7 PLDI 22 moving between the types

- Linter tools for standard PR feedback 

- https://github.com/jackfirth/resyntax

- https://github.com/jackfirth/resyntax/blob/master/default-recommendations.rkt

#+begin_src rkt
test: "lambda variable definition with no arguments to function definition"
------------------------------
(define f
  (λ ()
    1))
------------------------------
------------------------------
(define (f)
  1)
------------------------------
#+end_src

** DONE What Can Beginners Learn from Video Games?

- Example: alien game

- Template: ~define~ the objects, ~check-expect~

- Use functoinal composition for OO style interfaces 

** DONE Design Recipe Guided Synthesis with Bingus

- https://con.racket-lang.org/htdp.org

- https://github.com/ralsei/bingus

- Uses the design recipe

#+begin_src rkt
(define-struct date (year month day))
#+end_src

- Example: depth that takes a Tree

#+begin_src rkt
(define (depth tree))
#+end_src

- https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/papers/OZ15.pdf

- This seems similar to https://github.com/webyrd/Barliman

** REVIEW Stacker: A runnable notional machine for an HtDP-like language

- https://beautifulracket.com/stacker/ 
#+begin_src rkt
#lang http/asl

(define (f x) x)
#+end_src

- stacks and linking

** TODO Examplar: Making Hay from Wheat

- https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-programmable-prog-lang/paper.pdf

- Comes back to providing good examples

- Implement: ~median~

- Implement: ~sum~

- Implement: ~append~

- Implement: ~median~

- Implement: ~overlap~ (docdiff)

#+begin_src rkt
  (define (overlap l1 l2))
#+end_src

- https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2020/docdiff.html

- See also https://github.com/webyrd/Barliman

- Look at creating tests as "buggies" that are the counter examples 

- Should should the meta for students to understand how things will break when in the course

- left median error 

- there are the set up issues that come up for student solutions 

- write counter examples as an expert for the system under development
